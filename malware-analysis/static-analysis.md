# Static Malware Analysis

## File Type Identification
This header refers to the process of identifying the type of file being analyzed. This is important as different file types may require different analysis techniques.

## Fingerprinting
Fingerprinting involves generating unique identifiers for a file that can be used to match it against known malware samples. This can involve generating hashes or fuzzy hashes of the file.

### Generating hashes
Hashing is the process of generating a unique fixed-length identifier for a file. This can be used to quickly identify whether a file matches a known sample.

### Generating fuzzy hashes
Fuzzy hashing involves generating a hash that takes into account small variations in the file, making it useful for identifying variants of known malware.

## Strings
This header refers to the process of searching for specific strings within a file that may indicate malicious behavior or functionality.

## Obfuscation
Obfuscation refers to techniques used to hide or obscure the true purpose of code within a file.

### Encoders
Encoders are used to transform the binary code within a file into a different format that may be more difficult to read or analyze.

### Cryptors
Cryptors are used to encrypt or decrypt the binary code within a file, making it more difficult to analyze.

### Packers
Packers are used to compress and/or encrypt the binary code within a file, making it more difficult to analyze and/or to hide malicious behavior.

## Identify obfuscation
This header refers to the techniques used to identify obfuscation within a file.

### Entropy
Entropy is a measure of the randomness of the data within a file. High entropy may indicate that a file has been obfuscated.

### Section Naming
Section naming refers to the names given to specific sections of a file. Unusual or suspicious section names may indicate that a file has been obfuscated.

### Examining the imports
Analyzing the imports within a file can reveal information about the libraries and functions being used. Suspicious imports may indicate that a file has been obfuscated or may be malicious.
